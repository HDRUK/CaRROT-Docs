As described on [https://co-connect.ac.uk](https://co-connect.ac.uk), the input data for the ETL process must be in the form of `csv` data dumps, that are formatted to a particular data-standard.

This part of the ETL process must be performed manually by the data-partner.

The 2nd part of the extract process (pseudonymisation) is optionally automated as part of the ETL.
