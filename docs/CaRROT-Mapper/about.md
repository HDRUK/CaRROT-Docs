# CaRROT-Mapper

[CaRROT-Mapper](https://github.com/HDRUK/CaRROT-Mapper) is a webapp which allows the user 
to map the metadata from a dataset to the OMOP standard, and produce mapping rules
for ingestion by [CaRROT-CDM](https://github.com/HDRUK/CaRROT-CDM) to perform the
mapping of the contents of the dataset to OMOP.

CaRROT-Mapper is built using Python, Django and React, with a PostgreSQL database,
and is hosted in Azure using Azure App Services, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, 
and Azure Functions.
